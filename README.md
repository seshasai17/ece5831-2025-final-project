We implemented Driver drowsiness detection on MRL eye dataset and trained it using two models they are: 
1. Custom CNN model
2. MobileNetV2 model

These implementations are present in Driver_Drowsiness_Detection.ipynb and these models are saved as cnn_drowsiness_model.h5 and mobilenet_drowsiness_model.h5 which are used for live feed using camera implementation.
For implementing Live camera feed open live_demo.py and enter command in terminal 
"python live_demo.py --model_path path_of_your_model" this will be explained more clearly in my Live_demo video.

I have Included ipynb file which has the implementation of models and live_demo.py for live camera feed implementation, along with that I have also included both the models in the repo for live camera feed implementation.
